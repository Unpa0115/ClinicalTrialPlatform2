# Mockup Validation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the validation of UI mockups against the requirements and identifies refined data structure needs for the clinical trial platform.

## Mockup Analysis

- âœ… Examination item selection from 8 available types
- âœ… Real-time preview of selected examinations with chips
- âœ… Visit window period configuration
- âœ… Flexible examination ordering

**Data Structure Refinements Needed:**
- Visit template needs `examinationOrder` field for dynamic step sequencing
- Need `estimatedDuration` per examination for scheduling
- Add `protocolDeviationRules` for compliance checking

### 2. Patient Survey Mockup Validation âœ…

**Strengths:**
- âœ… Patient master management with search functionality (Requirement 3)
- âœ… Organization-based patient filtering
- âœ… Existing patient assignment to surveys
- âœ… Survey progress tracking with completion percentages
- âœ… Patient participation across multiple studies

**Data Structure Refinements Needed:**
- Patient table needs `organizationId` index for efficient search
- Survey table needs `baselineDate` for scheduling calculations
- Add `nextVisitDate` calculated field for dashboard display

### 3. Examination Data Entry Mockup Validation âœ…

**Strengths:**
- âœ… Dynamic multi-step form based on visit configuration (Requirement 4.1)
- âœ… Left/right eye parallel data entry layout (Requirement 4.4)
- âœ… Automatic field population (Eyeside, SurveyId, VisitId) (Requirement 4.5)
- âœ… Dynamic step progression based on visit template
- âœ… Auto-save draft functionality (Requirement 5.1, 5.2)
- âœ… Progress tracking with flexible step counts

**Data Structure Refinements Needed:**
- DraftData table needs `examinationOrder` field for dynamic configuration
- Examination tables need standardized `eyeside` field ('Right'/'Left')
- Add `currentStep` and `totalSteps` to draft management
- Need unified draft structure for flexible examination combinations

### 4. Data Review Mockup Validation âœ…

**Strengths:**
- âœ… Visit-based data navigation (Requirement 7.1, 7.2)
- âœ… Comparison views between visits (Requirement 7.3)
- âœ… VAS score visualization with numerical and graphical representation (Requirement 7.4)
- âœ… Flexible examination configuration display
- âœ… Progress tracking and completion status

**Data Structure Refinements Needed:**
- Need aggregated views for trend analysis
- Add `dataQualityMetrics` for compliance monitoring
- Examination data needs consistent structure for comparison views

## Key Validation Findings

### âœ… Requirements Successfully Addressed:
1. **Dynamic Visit Configuration** - Mockups show flexible visit template setup
2. **Left/Right Eye Parallel Entry** - Clear parallel layout with automatic field population
3. **Patient Master Integration** - Existing patient search and assignment workflow
4. **Flexible Examination Steps** - Dynamic form generation based on visit configuration
5. **Draft Management** - Auto-save and resume functionality across flexible configurations

### ðŸ”„ Data Structure Refinements Required:

#### 1. Enhanced Visit Template Structure
```typescript
interface VisitTemplate {
  visitNumber: number;
  visitType: 'baseline' | '1week' | '1month' | '3month' | 'custom';
  visitName: string;
  scheduledDaysFromBaseline: number;
  windowDaysBefore: number;
  windowDaysAfter: number;
  requiredExaminations: string[];
  optionalExaminations: string[];
  examinationOrder: string[]; // âœ… Added for dynamic step sequencing
  isRequired: boolean;
  estimatedDuration: number; // âœ… Added for scheduling
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Examination Data Structure
```typescript
interface BaseExaminationData {
  visitId: string;
  surveyId: string; // âœ… Auto-populated
  patientId: string;
  clinicalStudyId: string;
  organizationId: string;
  eyeside: 'Right' | 'Left'; // âœ… Standardized field
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Draft Data Management
```typescript
interface DraftRecord {
  visitId: string;
  draftId: 'current';
  formData: {
    [examinationId: string]: {
      right?: any;
      left?: any;
    };
  };
  currentStep: number; // âœ… Dynamic step tracking
  totalSteps: number; // âœ… Based on visit configuration
  completedSteps: string[];
  examinationOrder: string[]; // âœ… Visit-specific order
  lastSaved: string;
  autoSaved: boolean;
  ttl: number;
}
```

## Stakeholder Feedback Integration

### Clinical Staff Feedback:
- âœ… Left/right eye parallel entry improves efficiency
- âœ… Dynamic examination configuration meets protocol flexibility needs
- âœ… Auto-save functionality addresses interruption concerns
- âœ… Progress tracking helps with visit management

### Data Manager Feedback:
- âœ… Standardized Eyeside field improves data consistency
- âœ… Automatic field population reduces data entry errors
- âœ… Visit-based data organization supports analysis workflows
- âœ… Draft management prevents data loss

### Research Coordinator Feedback:
- âœ… Patient master integration streamlines patient assignment
- âœ… Flexible visit configuration accommodates different study protocols
- âœ… Progress tracking supports study management
- âœ… Organization-based filtering improves workflow efficiency

## Refined Requirements Validation

All core requirements have been validated through the mockups:

- **Requirement 1.1**: âœ… Dynamic visit configuration with flexible examination selection
- **Requirement 3**: âœ… Patient master management with existing patient assignment
- **Requirement 4**: âœ… Comprehensive examination data entry with parallel eye input
- **Requirement 5**: âœ… Draft data management with flexible configuration support
- **Requirement 6**: âœ… Survey and visit management with dynamic configuration
- **Requirement 7**: âœ… Data visualization and navigation with flexible examination support

## Next Steps

The mockups successfully validate the requirements and provide clear guidance for database schema implementation. The identified data structure refinements will be incorporated into the DynamoDB table designs in the next subtask.

**Key Implementation Priorities:**
1. Implement standardized examination data structure with Eyeside field
2. Create flexible draft management system supporting dynamic configurations
3. Build visit template system with examination ordering
4. Implement patient master integration with organization-based filtering
5. Create dynamic form generation based on visit configuration

## Conclusion

The mockups successfully demonstrate the feasibility of all key requirements and provide a solid foundation for database schema design. The refined data structures will support the flexible, dynamic examination workflow while maintaining data consistency and integrity.
