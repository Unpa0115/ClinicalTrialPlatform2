# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the clinical trial platform's management interfaces. Currently, the platform has basic list views for clinical studies, organizations, and patient master data, but lacks the ability to create, edit, or delete these entities through the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clinical Study Management CRUD

**User Story:** As a study administrator, I want to create, edit, and manage clinical studies through a user-friendly interface, so that I can efficiently set up and maintain clinical trial protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a study administrator accesses the clinical studies page THEN the system SHALL display a "新規臨床試験作成" button
2. WHEN the administrator clicks the create button THEN the system SHALL display a multi-step clinical study creation form
3. WHEN the administrator fills out the study details THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields including study name, description, protocol version, and target organizations
4. WHEN the administrator configures visit templates THEN the system SHALL allow adding/removing visits with examination configurations
5. WHEN the administrator saves a clinical study THEN the system SHALL create the study record and display a success confirmation
6. WHEN the administrator clicks on an existing study THEN the system SHALL display detailed study information with edit capabilities
7. WHEN the administrator modifies study details THEN the system SHALL save changes and maintain audit trail
8. WHEN the administrator attempts to delete a study with active participants THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show appropriate warning

### Requirement 2: Organization Management CRUD

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to create and manage healthcare organizations participating in clinical trials, so that I can control access and track organizational capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super administrator accesses the organizations page THEN the system SHALL display a "新規組織登録" button
2. WHEN the administrator clicks the create button THEN the system SHALL display an organization registration form
3. WHEN the administrator enters organization details THEN the system SHALL validate organization name, contact information, and capabilities
4. WHEN the administrator saves an organization THEN the system SHALL create the organization record with pending approval status
5. WHEN the administrator views an organization THEN the system SHALL display detailed organization information with edit capabilities
6. WHEN the administrator updates organization status THEN the system SHALL change the status and notify relevant users
7. WHEN the administrator assigns studies to organizations THEN the system SHALL create proper associations and access controls
8. WHEN the administrator attempts to delete an organization with active studies THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show appropriate warning

### Requirement 3: Patient Master Management CRUD

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to register and manage patient master records for my organization, so that I can efficiently assign patients to clinical studies while maintaining data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization administrator accesses the patient master page THEN the system SHALL display a "新規患者登録" button
2. WHEN the administrator clicks the create button THEN the system SHALL display a patient registration form
3. WHEN the administrator enters patient details THEN the system SHALL validate patient code uniqueness within the organization
4. WHEN the administrator saves a patient record THEN the system SHALL create the anonymized patient record with active status
5. WHEN the administrator views a patient THEN the system SHALL display patient information with edit capabilities for authorized fields
6. WHEN the administrator updates patient medical information THEN the system SHALL save changes and maintain audit trail
7. WHEN the administrator assigns a patient to a study THEN the system SHALL create survey records and update participation tracking
8. WHEN the administrator changes patient status THEN the system SHALL update the status and handle study participation accordingly

### Requirement 4: Form Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user creating or editing records, I want clear validation feedback and error messages, so that I can successfully complete data entry tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a form with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL highlight the fields and display specific error messages
2. WHEN a user enters invalid data formats THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
3. WHEN a user attempts to create duplicate records THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a network error occurs during form submission THEN the system SHALL display retry options and preserve form data
